# Image-Colour-Palette-Generator
This simple **Flask**-based website allows you to extract colors from your image files.
Just upload an image and it will give you:
- The image color palette (up to 10 colors)
- The top 20 most common colors in that image.

I am aware that my Python code is far from perfect but I just wanted to get something working using my own code.
Inspired from [Image Color Extract][color-extract] tool.
